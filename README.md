# VueAndBootstrap

Examples of VueJS and Bootstrap working together

----

This is a set of **self-contained** examples of using VueJS and Bootstrap together. They are intended to demonstrate
basic concepts of VueJS within an attractive, commonly-used UI framework.

No additional build tools are required. All JS is loaded from CDNs. The focus here is on learning VueJS and how it can
be applied to existing projects without adopting a new toolchain or throwing out old, working code.
